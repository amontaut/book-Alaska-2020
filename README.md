# book-Alaska-2020

This website is made for a fictional writer who posts one chapter of his new book every week so that people can read it for free. I completed this project on June 17, 2020.

The main features are : 
- Front end : 
  - anyone is able to read all chapters
  - anyone is able to post comments
  - anyone is able to report comments
- Back end 
  - the admin (so the writer) has an account and can create, update, and delete chapters
  - the admin can create and write his chapter thanks to a WYSIWYG interface (TinyMCE https://www.tiny.cloud)
  - the admin can moderate all comments
  - there's a "forgotten password" feature to reset the password thanks to PhpMailer
- PHP/mySQL
- MVC (model, view, controller) pattern
- Object-oriented programming
- basic security stuff (password hashed, XSS flaw, SQL injections) 
- resonsive obviously

In this repo, you will find :
- export.sql : the database
- source_code : where all the source code is
- Prez-fr.pdf : presentation of the website in french ðŸ¥–

The website was once hosted and online but isn't anymore ðŸ¤¡
